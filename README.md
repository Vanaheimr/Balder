Blueprints.NET is a [property graph model interface](http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph). It also provides implementations, test suites, and supporting extensions. Graph databases and frameworks that implement the Blueprints interfaces automatically support Blueprints-enabled applications. Likewise, Blueprints-enabled applications can plug-and-play different Blueprints-enabled graph backends.
