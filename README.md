Blueprints.NET is a [property graph model interface](http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph) for .NET/Mono. [Graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) [databases](http://www.graph-database.org) and frameworks that implement the Blueprints interface automatically support Blueprints-enabled applications. Likewise, Blueprints-enabled applications can plug-and-play different Blueprints-enabled graph backends.

Blueprints does not define an interface for remote network access. For a [HTTP/REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) interface please take a look at [Rexster.NET](http://github.com/ahzf/rexster.NET).

#### Implementations

* [Gera](http://github.com/ahzf/Gera) Framework for processing large-scale semantic graphs.

#### Acknowledgments

Blueprints.NET is a port of the [blueprints](http://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints) library for Java provided by [Tinkerpop](http://tinkerpop.com).
