Blueprints.NET is a [property graph model interface](http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph) for .NET/Mono. Graph databases and frameworks that implement the Blueprints interface automatically support Blueprints-enabled applications. Likewise, Blueprints-enabled applications can plug-and-play different Blueprints-enabled graph backends.

Blueprints does not define an interface for remote network access. For a HTTP/REST interface please take a look at [Rexster.Net](http://github.com/ahzf/rexster.NET).

#### Implementations
